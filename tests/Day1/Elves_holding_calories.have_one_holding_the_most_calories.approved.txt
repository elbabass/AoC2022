For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:
------
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
------
In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: theyâ€™d like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the Elf number 4)
